If you want to update the timeline, drop a mail to the maintainer (Andreas Lundqvist) and tell
him how long you wish to "reserve" it in order to prevent two people making changes at the same time.

The recommended program to edit the timeline is Inkscape.

Please take care to work as PRECISELY as possible. Here are some guidelines:

* The font is Blue Highway, which can be downloaded from www.dafont.com (or Google).

* The width of the distro lines should be kept at 3 pixel units (turn off "scale width when resizing").

* Each distro line is centered on a horizontal grid line.

* The distro lines are at steps of 2 grid units apart from each other.

* When adding new year lines, the distance is exactly 115 pixel units.

* Keep the dots, lines and names in their corresponding layers.

* The color of a distro dot and line should match its "flag color". (Debian = dark red, etc.)

* Add your name to the "Updates:" in the Info-Box.

* Write all changes into the CHANGELOG.


Feel free to change things! If you think this file or the README can be improved, do it!
The same goes for the colors and layout of the timeline, the "packaging" of the project and
everything else. Just make it clear in the CHANGELOG.
