GNU/LINUX DISTRO TIMELINE | README

- The SVG is optimized for the font Blue Highway and has not been tested with other fonts. Blue Highway is available at http://www.typemotion.de/_typographie/blue_highway.php and at many of the free font resources on the web.
- When you contact me concerning adding distributions, please supply links to verify the data if possible. The month and year of the first public release (likewise if the project is dead) is important, as well as upon which distribution it is based. Thank you for your help.
- The timeline is inspired by "LÃ­nea del tiempo Distribuciones Linux" by A. Sandoval (alexdark), whose work is available at http://kde-files.org.
