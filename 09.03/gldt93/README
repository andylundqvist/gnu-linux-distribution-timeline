GNU/LINUX DISTRO TIMELINE | README

All content is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

If you wish to do some work or make changes to the project, please
read the INFO file in the CONTRIBUTE folder.

When you contact me concerning adding distributions, please supply links
to verify the data. The month and year of the first public release
(likewise if the project is dead) is important, as well as upon which
distribution it is based.
However, since the project is now community-driven, it is preferable
that you do the changes yourself and send them in.

The timeline is inspired by "LÃ­nea del tiempo Distribuciones Linux" by
A. Sandoval (alexdark), whose work is available at http://kde-files.org.
