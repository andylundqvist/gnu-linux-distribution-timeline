GNU/LINUX DISTRO TIMELINE | CONTRIBUTE/TODO

Use this file just like a regular todo-file.
Delete lines that have been implemented/cleared up.
Ideally, this file should be as empty as possible.


============================================

* Devise a good way to handle the vertical connectors. They're a pain when updating.
Suggestion: don't add any new connectors, but keep the old ones intact.

* Add Rxart, a very popular distro in Argentina (not easy to find exact info)
* Add Midori Linux (March 2001 - ? ... seems dormant now), an influential ultralightweight distro by Transmeta.
* Add µClinux forks (find out the exact month): µClinux SBK (1998-2001), µClinux-dist (1999-?), Arcturus Networks µClinux (2001-?), BlackFin µClinux (2003-?)
* Add DemoLinux (probably the first LiveCD distro), started in 1998 based on Mandrake, version 2 (Apr 2000) based on Debian, discontinued in July 2002.

* Fix the "SUSE question": Is it now SUSE/SLED/SLES/SLERT and how do the main line and branches (together with openSUSE) look?
-> also include Novell Linux. See Benjamin Campbell's e-mail in the SUGGESTIONS file.
(ask someone working at SUSE?)

* Fix the "RedHat question": Is it called simply RedHat or RHEL/RHED and when did the renaming occur (month, year)?
(ask someone working at RedHat?)


* When adding the following, check if they're still alive today. Don't forget to delete the ones you added.
