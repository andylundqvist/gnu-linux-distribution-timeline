GNU/LINUX DISTRO TIMELINE | CONTRIBUTE/SUGGESTIONS

These are user messages with suggestions.
Quite messy and probably lots of duplicates.
Implement at will and delete the items you have implemented/fixed.
Ideally, this file should be as empty as possible.

============================================

SLES, SLED, and SLERT all share a common base with SUSE Linux but are packaged with different packages and modules.
Updates to the SUSE Linux distro eventually get passed on to SLE (SUSE Linux Enterprise) family.
I don't know if those really count as a separate distro's for your poster but if it does here's how they would fit in:

S.u.S.E (1994)

SuSE (December 1998)
|
|----> SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) (October 31, 2000) ----> (present day)
|
V
SUSE Linux (September 2003)
|
V
Novell acquires SUSE Linux (January 2004)
|
|----> NLD (Novell Linux Desktop) (November 8, 2004) ----> SLED (SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop) (mid 2006) ----> (present day)
|----> SLERT (SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time) (October 24, 2006) ----> (present day)
|
V
openSUSE (December 7, 2006) (NOTE: "openSUSE" is really a name change from "SUSE Linux" rather than a new distro.)
