GNU/LINUX DISTRO TIMELINE | CONTRIBUTE/INFO

If you want to update the timeline, drop a mail to the maintainer
(Andreas Lundqvist) and tell him how long you wish to "reserve" it
in order to prevent two people making changes at the same time.

The recommended program to edit the .svgz is Inkscape.

The main file to work upon is the TODO.
If you run out of work, take a look at the SUGGESTIONS file (user e-mails).

Updating the distribution_data.ods spreadsheed is welcome.

Feel free to change things. If you think any of these files can be improved,
do it! The same goes for the colors and layout of the timeline, the "packaging"
of the project and everything else. Just make it clear in the CHANGELOG.

============================================

Please take care to work as _precisely_ as possible.
Here are some guidelines:

* The font is Blue Highway, which can be downloaded from
www.dafont.com (or Google).

* The width of the distro lines should be kept at 3 pixel units
(turn off "scale width when resizing").

* Each distro line is centered on a horizontal grid line.

* The distro lines are at steps of 2 grid units apart from each other.

* When adding new year lines, the distance is exactly 115 pixel units.

* Keep the dots, lines and names in their corresponding layers.

* The color of a distro dot and line should match its "flag color".
(Debian = dark red, etc.)

* Add your name to the "Updates:" in the Info-Box.

* Write all changes into the CHANGELOG.

* Try to add more than just 1 distro. (see TODO and SUGGESTIONS)

* Do not alter history. Neither for your favourite distro nor those you dislike.
Unless you're absolutely sure, consult the maintainer.
